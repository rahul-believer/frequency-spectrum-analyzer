# frequency-spectrum-analyzer
A frequency analyzer built on top of p5 sound with almost zero latency.

This project can also be used as free replacement of VST plugin SPAN.

Explaination - The idea behind this small project is to convert it into a VST plugin for audio workstations (AFTER SOME SERIOUS DESIGN TWEAKS) and use as a frequency visualizer.
Further features like comparison could also be added in further versions.
